// Rust is a language with much to learn. Fortunately, you don't need to know
// everything before becoming productive. It's very a much a learn-as-you-go
// language.
//
// Major topics you may still encounter:
//
// - Module system
// - Macros
// - Async
// - Multi-threading
// - Unsafe
//
// As always, the Rust book is a great resource for diving in on your own.
// But if you feel additional courses would be helpful, please let me know!
