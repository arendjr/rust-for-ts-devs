# Rust for TypeScript developers

Welcome to the `rust-for-ts-devs` repo! This repo is intended to collect various
small lessons about Rust that I can present in courses. As the title indicates,
the audience is expected to be familiar with TypeScript, and we will use this
TypeScript knowledge as a stepping stone to see where Rust diverges, in hopes to
(eventually) become an effective Rust engineer.

This course is *not* intended to be a comprehensive reference into all things
Rust. Even if you complete this course, there will be plenty you don't know yet.
If you wish to dive deeper, I can whole-heartedly recommend the Rust Book:

  https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

Or consult any of the other learning materials made available by the Rust
community:
